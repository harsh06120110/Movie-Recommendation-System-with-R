# Movie-recomendation-
Movie recommendation system with R  using content filtering and collaborative filtering

 I attempt to use both the Content-based Filtering approach and the Collaborative Filtering approach to build a basic movie recommendation engine.
 
 I uploaded the dataset for the reference.
 
 The Content-based Filtering Approach:-
 the Content-based Filtering approach involves analyzing an item a user interacted with, and giving recommendations that are similar in content to that item. Content, in this case, refers to a set of attributes/features that describes your item. For a movie recommendation engine, a content-based approach would be to recommend movies that are of highest similarity based on its features, such as genres, actors, directors, year of production, etc. The assumption here is that users have preferences for a certain type of product, so we try to recommend a similar product to what the user has expressed liking for. Also, the goal here is to provide alternatives or substitutes to the item that was viewed.
 
 The User-Based Collaborative Filtering Approach:-
The User-Based Collaborative Filtering approach groups users according to prior usage behavior or according to their preferences, and then recommends an item that a similar user in the same group viewed or liked. To put this in layman terms, if user 1 liked movie A, B and C, and if user 2 liked movie A and B, then movie C might make a good recommendation to user 2. The User-Based Collaborative Filtering approach mimics how word-of-mouth recommendations work in real life.


 I give comments in code that you can understand the functionality of the CODE.
